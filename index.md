The goal of this blog is simple. Explain in five minutes, the core idea behind ML papers. Every paper (well deserved) introduction, elaborate experiments and a lot. But the key idea generally is explanable in short (hopefully in five minute read). So this effort is to give a succint idea of paper to improve productivity of researchers and enthusiasts.

For now, it is just my note taking tool
